The current activity is focused on getting the PROActive OS project back on its development path for the "Production-Grade Manual System" (Version 1.0).

**Current Focus:**
*   **Memory Bank Alignment:** Updating core memory bank files (`development-roadmap.md`, `project-overview.md`, `current-activity.md`, `project-log.md`) to reflect the current project vision, mission, and module statuses for the manual system.
*   **Estimate Creation Workflow:** Resolved TypeScript errors in document management and integrated the "Files" section into the Estimate form.
*   **Module Status Clarification:** Identifying and documenting which core modules are functional and which still require completion for the Version 1.0 manual system.

This ensures all team members are on the same page regarding the project's current goals and development priorities.
