## Current Work Focus

The immediate focus is on completing Phase 3: "UI/UX Refinements & AI Insights Panel". The first sub-task is "Side Drawer Forms: Refine design and responsiveness for all side drawer forms. Implement consistent validation and error handling." The second sub-task for Phase 3 is "AI Assistant Chat: Enhance chat interface for better user interaction and clarity of AI responses. Implement streaming responses for a more dynamic experience."

## Recent Completed Actions

-   **Side Drawer Forms:** Refined design and responsiveness for `app/people/person-form.tsx` and `app/opportunities/opportunity-form.tsx` by adding `ScrollArea`. Converted `app/people/[id]/edit/page.tsx`, `app/opportunities/[id]/edit/page.tsx`, `app/people/new/page.tsx`, and `app/opportunities/new/page.tsx` to side drawers and increased their width. Implemented consistent validation and error handling.
-   **AI Assistant Chat:** Refactored `app/api/ai/assistant-chat/route.ts` to support streaming responses and `components/ai/AssistantChatDrawer.tsx` to use `useChat` hook.
-   **Error Fixes:**
    -   `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`: Fixed `params.id` warning and date property access.
    -   `app/api/ai/draft-communication/route.ts`: Fixed Supabase import, malformed paths, and `estimateDetails.title`.
    -   `app/opportunities/[id]/page.tsx`: Fixed `params.id` warning, `opportunity_name` access, and `NewOpportunity` import/usage.

    -   Zep Client initialized (`lib/zep.ts`).
    -   Zep User/Session management and message logging are functional.
    -   `ZepSearchTool` integrated for active memory.

    -   Initial tabbed UI (`app/agent-workspace/page.tsx`) with "Dashboard", "Activity Logs", "Performance Metrics", "Configuration", and "Error Logs" tabs is in place.
    -   `components/sidebar.tsx` updated to have a single link to `/agent-workspace`.
    -   `TypeError` related to `recharts` in `app/agent-workspace/page.tsx` corrected by adding `"use client"` directive.
-   **Opportunities Module AI Enhancements:**
    -   Predictive Lead Scoring: `lead_score` column added to Supabase, `calculate-lead-score.ts` tool created and integrated into `main-agent.ts`. `lib/opportunities.ts` and `app/opportunities/opportunity-list.tsx` updated to fetch and display the score.
    -   Automated Opportunity Updates: `suggest-opportunity-update.ts` tool created and integrated into `main-agent.ts`. `app/opportunities/components/opportunity-suggestions.tsx` created and integrated into `app/opportunities/opportunity-form.tsx` to display suggestions.
    -   AI-Driven Suggestions for Next Steps: `suggest-next-action.ts` tool created and integrated into `main-agent.ts`. `app/opportunities/components/opportunity-suggestions.tsx` is ready to display these actions.
-   **Jobs Module (Task Management):**
    -   `jobs` table modified to link `assigned_to` to `people` table, and new columns (`due_date`, `due_time`, `priority`, `linked_contact_id`, `linked_opportunity_id`, `tags`) added. `job_checklist_items` table created.
