    - [x] Functional tests for `opportunityService` (`lib/opportunities.ts`) methods (get, create, update, delete) including filtering and relationships.
    - [x] End-to-end tests for `app/opportunities/page.tsx` to ensure correct display and filtering of opportunities.
- [x] **AI-Driven Features Testing:**
    - [x] **Predictive Lead Scoring:**
        - [x] Unit tests for lead scoring logic (mock).
        - [x] Integration tests to verify AI agent correctly calculates and updates scores (mock).
        - [x] UI functional tests for displaying lead score in `opportunity-list.tsx`.
    - [x] **Automated Opportunity Updates:**
        - [x] Unit tests for communication parsing and update suggestion logic (mock).
        - [x] Integration tests to verify AI agent correctly suggests updates based on input (mock).
        - [x] UI functional tests for displaying suggested updates in `opportunity-form.tsx` via `opportunity-suggestions.tsx`.
    - [x] **AI-Driven Suggestions for Next Steps:**
        - [x] Unit tests for suggestion generation logic (mock).
        - [x] Integration tests to verify AI agent provides relevant next steps (mock).
        - [x] UI functional tests for displaying suggested actions in `opportunity-form.tsx` via `opportunity-suggestions.tsx`.
- [x] **UI/UX Improvements Testing:**
    - [x] Usability testing for `opportunity-form.tsx` and `opportunity-list.tsx` (manual).
