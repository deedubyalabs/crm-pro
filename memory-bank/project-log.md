# Project Log: PROActive OS - Your Operations Hub for Construction Success

**Version:** 1.0 (Production-Grade Manual System)
**Last Updated:** June 13, 2025

## Milestones Achieved (Historical - AI Focus)

*   **AI Agent Infrastructure:** Initial setup and integration of LangGraph.js agents, Supabase as Agent Data Fabric (ADF), Google Gemini API, and custom TypeScript tools for LLM interactions. Checkpointers were implemented for conversational state persistence.
*   **People Management (AI Context):** Implemented generic tools for contact management with AI integration points. Refined `person_type` enum and UI filters.
*   **Zep Integration:** Initial integration of Zep Client for active memory and message logging.
*   **Agent Workspace:** Developed initial tabbed UI for AI monitoring and configuration.
*   **Opportunities Module AI Enhancements:** Implemented predictive lead scoring, automated opportunity updates, and AI-driven suggestions for next steps.
*   **Core Utilities (AI Context):** Ensured robust Supabase client, Zod schemas for validation, and regenerated Supabase types to support AI-related features.
*   **Jobs Module (AI Context):** Updated database schema for `jobs` table and implemented checklist functionality with AI-adapted status update logic.
*   **UI/UX Refinements (AI Context):** Refined side drawer forms and enhanced chat interface for AI assistant interactions.

## Key Issues Resolved (Historical - AI Focus)

*   Resolved various `params.id` warnings and data access issues in Next.js pages.
*   Fixed Supabase imports and type compatibility issues in API routes and utility files.
*   Addressed `TypeError` related to `recharts` in the Agent Workspace UI.

## Evolution of Project Decisions (Historical - AI Focus)

*   Previous architectural decisions focused on LangGraph.js/TypeScript for AI agents, Supabase as ADF, and Zep for active memory.
*   Emphasis was placed on enhancing existing modules with AI capabilities and integrating conversational interfaces.
*   New modules like "Jobs" were introduced with AI considerations.
*   Exploration of AI assistance in various workflows such as estimation, bidding, project management, and task management.

## Current Project Focus & Recent Updates

*   **Shift to Manual System Focus:** The project has re-aligned its immediate development efforts to achieve a stable and production-grade "Manual System" (Version 1.0) as outlined in the updated `project-overview.md`. Future AI integrations are now considered a separate, subsequent phase.
*   **Memory Bank Synchronization:** All core memory bank files (`development-roadmap.md`, `project-overview.md`, `current-activity.md`, `project-log.md`) have been reviewed and updated to reflect the current project vision, module statuses, and development priorities for the manual system. This ensures a unified understanding of the project's current state and goals.
*   **Estimate Creation Workflow - Files Section:** Resolved TypeScript errors in `proactive-os/lib/documents.ts` and `proactive-os/app/estimates/components/EstimateDocumentsSection.tsx`, and successfully integrated the `EstimateDocumentsSection` into `proactive-os/app/estimates/estimate-form.tsx`.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   Maintaining clear and up-to-date project documentation is crucial for effective development, especially when project priorities or scopes evolve.
*   The foundational work on the core modules, even with previous AI considerations, provides a solid base for the manual system.
