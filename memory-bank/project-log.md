**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 26, 2025

## Milestones Achieved

-   **AI Agent Infrastructure:**
    -   LangGraph.js agents are successfully integrated into Next.js API routes.
    -   Supabase is functioning as the Agent Data Fabric (ADF).
    -   Google Gemini API is integrated and working for LLM interactions.
    -   Custom TypeScript tools are callable by the LLM.
    -   Checkpointers are persisting conversational state.
-   **People Management:**
    -   Generic `create-person`, `get-person-details`, and `update-person` tools are implemented and integrated.
    -   `main-agent.ts` is updated to use new generic tools and naming conventions.
    -   `person_type` enum in Supabase and corresponding UI filter (`app/people/people-type-filter.tsx`) are correctly updated (removed "Other" value).
    -   Employees can be assigned to jobs and project tasks.
-   **Zep Integration:**
    -   Zep Client initialized (`lib/zep.ts`).
    -   Zep User/Session management and message logging are functional.
    -   `ZepSearchTool` is integrated and working for active memory.
-   **Agent Workspace:**
    -   Initial tabbed UI (`app/agent-workspace/page.tsx`) with "Dashboard", "Activity Logs", "Performance Metrics", "Configuration", and "Error Logs" tabs is in place.
    -   `components/sidebar.tsx` links correctly to `/agent-workspace`.
    -   `TypeError` related to `recharts` in `app/agent-workspace/page.tsx` resolved with `"use client"`.
-   **Opportunities Module AI Enhancements:**
    -   **Predictive Lead Scoring:** `lead_score` column added to Supabase, `calculate-lead-score.ts` tool created and integrated into `main-agent.ts`. `lib/opportunities.ts` and `app/opportunities/opportunity-list.tsx` updated to fetch and display the score.
    -   **Automated Opportunity Updates:** `suggest-opportunity-update.ts` tool created and integrated into `main-agent.ts`. `app/opportunities/components/opportunity-suggestions.tsx` created and integrated into `app/opportunities/opportunity-form.tsx` to display suggestions.
    -   **AI-Driven Suggestions for Next Steps:** `suggest-next-action.ts` tool created and integrated into `main-agent.ts`. `app/opportunities/components/opportunity-suggestions.tsx` is ready to display these actions.
-   **Core Utilities:**
    -   Supabase client (`lib/supabase.ts`) and error handling are robust.
    -   Zod schemas are used for validation.
    -   Supabase types (`types/supabase.ts`) regenerated to include `lead_score`.
    -   All identified TypeScript errors related to type compatibility in `lib/opportunities.ts` and `app/opportunities/opportunity-form.tsx` have been resolved.
-   **Jobs Module (Task Management):**
    -   Database schema for `jobs` table updated with new columns and foreign keys, and `job_checklist_items` table created.
-   **UI/UX Refinements:**
    -   Side Drawer Forms: Refined design and responsiveness for `app/people/person-form.tsx` and `app/opportunities/opportunity-form.tsx` by adding `ScrollArea`. Converted `app/people/[id]/edit/page.tsx`, `app/opportunities/[id]/edit/page.tsx`, `app/people/new/page.tsx`, and `app/opportunities/new/page.tsx` to side drawers and increased their width. Implemented consistent validation and error handling.
    -   AI Assistant Chat: Enhanced chat interface for better user interaction and clarity of AI responses. Implemented streaming responses for a more dynamic experience and increased drawer width.

## Key Issues Resolved

-   `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`: Fixed `params.id` warning and date property access.
-   `app/api/ai/draft-communication/route.ts`: Fixed Supabase import, malformed paths, and `estimateDetails.title`.
-   `app/opportunities/[id]/page.tsx`: Fixed `params.id` warning, `opportunity_name` access, and `NewOpportunity` import/usage.
-   `lib/opportunities.ts`: Updated `status` type.
-   `lib/people.ts`: Updated `PersonType` enum and added type assertions.

## Learnings and Project Insights

-   The iterative process of integrating AI tools, updating data layers, and refining UI components is effective.
-   Careful management of Supabase schema and generated types is crucial for avoiding type errors.
-   `react-hook-form` and Zod require precise type alignment for smooth integration, especially with optional and enum fields.
